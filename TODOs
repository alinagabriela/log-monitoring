1. Write some tests
2. Move some logic from the artisan command
3. Create specific classes:
    Ex: entities for a log (with string $description, Carbon $staredAt, ?Carbon $endedAt, ..)
4. Maybe create a new command and run it periodically - every x minutes/hours, depends on the system
    - Depends on the application: it might not be needed if we want to monitor the log once in a while
5. Remove the duplicate code (do not iterate over the same array/logic twice)
6. TBC
